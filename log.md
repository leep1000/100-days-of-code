# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 24th February, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 

Started on FreeCodeCamp's survey form challenge for the basic HTML and CSS certification. Thought about making an old-school Match.com dating survey to add a little pizzazz to it. I bet this survey form isn't too far off what dating websites would've been like when I was born.

**Thoughts:** 

Got myself a little tangled up with my HTML - I could not seem to get two checkboxes to appear despite coding them. In the end, it was just a errant closing tag causing the issues. Need to work on best practices in terms of my structuring; it can be hard to find mistakes in a jumble of code.

### Day 1: 25th February, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 

Finished the HTML for the dating survey project, and it hits all the criteria for passing. The tasks are certainly getting harder, but keeping up for now. I set up my new office today, which is a breath of fresh air compared to what I had before.

**Thoughts:** 

It's nice that the structure of HTML and CSS are starting to feel like second nature to me now. Really enjoying the new work environment too. Not super coding related, but I've started to revise some A-Level maths (logs and inequalities) just to get my brain ready for the harder stuff once the bootcamp starts.

### Day 2: 26th February, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 

Took a small break from basic web design to improve my github knowledge, via [a cool interactive tutorial.](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) Really interesting to learn how a few commands have so much power.

**Thoughts:** 

It's a little scary to think how you can mess up an entire project with just a few errant commands. Merge conflicts looks scary.
