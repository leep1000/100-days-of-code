# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 24th February, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 

Started on FreeCodeCamp's survey form challenge for the basic HTML and CSS certification. Thought about making an old-school Match.com dating survey to add a little pizzazz to it. I bet this survey form isn't too far off what dating websites would've been like when I was born.

**Thoughts:** 

Got myself a little tangled up with my HTML - I could not seem to get two checkboxes to appear despite coding them. In the end, it was just a errant closing tag causing the issues. Need to work on best practices in terms of my structuring; it can be hard to find mistakes in a jumble of code.
